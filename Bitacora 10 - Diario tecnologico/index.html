        <h2 class="article_tittle">An Introduction To React With Ionic</h2>
        <p class="article_texto">Mobile app development using hybrid frameworks has come a long way since initial release in 2008. With the
          improvements being made to the JavaScript engine and improved processing power available to mobile phones,
          the major concern people had when they considered developing their apps using the hybrid approach — namely,
          performance — has all but been eliminated, and cross-platform frameworks have seen a surge in popularity.
          We're going to build a mobile application that pulls data from the Marvel Comics API; the data will show
          Marvel comics and you'll be able to choose your favorites. At the end, we'll create a native build of the
          project on Android.</p>

        <h2 class="article_tittle">Readability Algorithms Should Be Tools, Not Targets</h2>
        <p class="article_texto">Readability programs may seem like a godsend, but the worst thing writers can do is write to please them
          above all others. Finding your voice is hard enough without also trying to sound like everyone else.</p>

        <p class="article_tittle">In this first part of the Mirage JS Deep Dive series, we will be looking at Mirage JS models and
          associations. We'll take a closer look at what they are and the roles they play in crafting out
          production-ready frontend without an actual backend with Mirage JS.</p>

          <p>In light mode, all font colors are black and background is white. But what if some section of page has
            font color white and background color (or some other color scheme ) is black in light mode . And this is
            defined in css file. Then how can I do this?.</p>

          <h3>Isacc Salazar</h3>
          <p>If you're comparing this to svelte, I think you missed a lot of the point:
            <li>no build step</li>
            <li>minimal</li>
            <br>
            Svelte's whole point of of existence, stripping everything that does not provide any value at build time,
            would necessarily require a build step.
